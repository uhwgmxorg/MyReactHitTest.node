# MyReactHitTest

is a small, simple React/TypeScript application that allows users to place points on a canvas (in Set mode) and emits a sound in Hit mode when a point is hit with the mouse (Hit-Test). Additionally, points can be moved and all points can be deleted. Every action triggers a sound.

The program serves as the counterpart to MyHitTest (Link), a test WPF application that was originally developed to use this functionality to graphically define points for splines. These were necessary for interpolations of measurement values in the context of near-infrared spectroscopy measurements.

Essentially, the following concepts are demonstrated:

- React
- Playing sound
- Material UI - Menus (like Desktop Apps)


First the node modules must be installed using: 

`npm install`.

The web application can be started with: 

`npx vite`.
